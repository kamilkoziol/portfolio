# portfolio

Repo stores portfolio projects made using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, kind of personal stuff however you know, purpose of portofolio is to be shared so w/e.

## todo list

Some things have to be done:

1. Change some static info to info stored in DB. All static info is kept in form of JS object so changing it should be ezpz.
2. At this moment project carousel is made with external library which I'm very unhappy with - there will be time to do my own.
3. Some intro screen would be nice to have.
4. Maybe some small content animation to make it appear more pleasent.
5. BETTER LOGO.

## Deployment info

To start simply execute 'npm start' however please don't run my website anywhere.
